1.1. Core Mission & Vision
Mission Statement: To seamlessly connect blood donors with donation centers across Ho Chi Minh City, simplifying the blood donation process and fostering a vibrant, accessible community of life-savers.

Vision Statement: To become the national standard for blood donation management, empowering every citizen to contribute to a healthier Vietnam through an intelligently integrated and highly efficient digital ecosystem that seamlessly shares vital information with the national healthcare system.

1.2. Target Audience & User Roles
Primary Target Audience:

Vietnamese Citizens in Ho Chi Minh City (initially): A diverse group including students, office workers (private & government), and other working professionals who prioritize convenience, efficiency, and social responsibility.
Foreign Residents in Ho Chi Minh City: A smaller segment seeking a user-friendly and potentially multilingual platform for humanitarian contributions.
Key Motivations:

Convenience & Time-Saving: Online pre-registration speeds up the donation process and guarantees service at specific times (e.g., weekends).
Social Responsibility/Altruism: The desire to help others and contribute to the community.
Basic Health Information: Access to personal blood type information.
Improved User Experience: A desire for a modern, intuitive interface over an outdated one.
Main Pain Points:

Outdated UI/UX: The current website's user interface and experience are not modern.
Limited Backend Integration: Implies inefficiencies for both users and administrators.
Inconvenience of Traditional Registration: The need to wait for a number if not pre-registered.
Secondary Target Audiences:

Donation Center Employees: Including check-in staff, data entry personnel, and medical staff/doctors who need efficient tools to manage donor flow, input data, and screen donors.
Administrators/System Managers (at Intelin Technology Joint Stock Company): Responsible for overall system management, event scheduling, user accounts, content, and reporting.
Key User Roles:

Guest User: Browses information without logging in.
Registered Blood Donor: Registers for events, manages bookings, views history, takes surveys, accesses health info, and uses QR for check-in.


Center Staff: Manages check-ins, verifies identity, and updates donor status.
Medical Professional: Accesses health declarations, inputs screening results, and approves/defers donors.
System Administrator: Manages events, users, content, and analytics.
1.3. Brand Personality
Trustworthy & Reliable: Essential for handling sensitive health information and integrating with the national healthcare system.
Empathetic & Caring: Reflects the compassionate nature of blood donation and supports donors.
Efficient & Streamlined: Directly addresses the need for convenience and a modern experience.
Modern & Innovative: Aims to overcome the outdated UI/UX and showcases forward-thinking use of technology.
Community-Oriented & Inspiring: Fosters a sense of belonging and encourages broader participation.
1.4. Design Principles
1.4.1 Clarity & Simplicity (Aligned with Efficient & Streamlined Personality):

Principle: Every screen, interaction, and piece of information should be easy to understand and free of unnecessary clutter. Users should intuitively know what to do next without extensive thought.
Application: Use clear language, intuitive icons, and a logical flow for tasks like registration. Minimize steps where possible. This directly addresses the "outdated UI/UX" pain point and the "convenience" motivation.
1.4.2 Trust & Security (Aligned with Trustworthy & Reliable Personality):

Principle: The design must visually communicate trustworthiness and assure users their personal and health data are secure. Transparency in processes and clear communication regarding data handling are crucial.
Application: Utilize clean, professional aesthetics. Ensure secure login and data submission processes are clearly indicated. Provide clear explanations for data collection (e.g., medical declarations). This supports the "an toàn bảo mật thông tin cho người dùng" (information security and safety for users) goal of the existing system.

1.4.3 Empathy & Support (Aligned with Empathetic & Caring Personality):

Principle: The design should feel supportive and considerate of the user's journey, especially given the sensitive nature of blood donation. Provide helpful guidance, positive reinforcement, and easy access to support.
Application: Use encouraging microcopy. Provide clear error messages that guide users to solutions, not just state a problem. Include prominent contact/support options.
1.4.4 Efficiency & Responsiveness (Aligned with Efficient & Streamlined, Modern & Innovative Personality):

Principle: The application must deliver a fast, fluid, and consistent experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones). Users should be able to complete tasks quickly and easily, minimizing waiting times and effort.
Application: Optimize loading times, ensure touch-friendly interfaces, and adapt layouts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Streamline multi-step forms (like the registration process). This directly improves upon the "outdated UI/UX" and supports the goal of online registration for convenience.

1.4.5 Inspiration & Community (Aligned with Community-Oriented & Inspiring Personality):

Principle: The design should foster a sense of purpose and community, motivating users to donate and feel part of a larger, life-saving effort.
Application: Incorporate imagery and messaging that highlight the positive impact of donations (e.g., "save 3 lives per donation"). Consider features that allow users to share their donation journey or see the collective impact.

1.4.6 Intentional & Context-Aware Flow

Principle: The interface should adapt to the user's context and intent. We will avoid endless scrolling and passive information feeds, instead creating focused, "moment-based" experiences that show the user what matters most, when it matters most. Our design guides the user through a flow with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

Application: The homepage will adapt for new vs. returning donors. User dashboards will change based on the user's current status in their donation cycle (e.g., eligible to donate, appointment upcoming, post-donation). Feature flows will be presented as deliberate, step-by-step processes to reduce cognitive load and increase user confidence.
